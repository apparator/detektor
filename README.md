# Detektor

A library for finding similarities in code.


## Motivation

Created to find similarities of a set of code files. Used to compare a set of
hand-ins in programming education courses, and can report if similarity of code
in files are high.

## Usage

Takes a filehandler, reads it, creates some sort of signature based on keywords
and operators for a spesific language.

## Install

This package will be added to pypi soon, but for now:

    $ git clone git@github.com:apparator/detektor.git

No virtualenv? Currently this package uses standard Python modules only.
